# ðŸ¦† How to Make a Duck ðŸ¦†

If it looks, walks, and quacks like a duck, then either a great deal of thought
and care went into determining and replicating the observable properties
of ducks, or else it's a duck. Unfortunately ducks do not grow on source trees by chance
(despite the prevalence of duck-typed programming systems) so we programmers are stuck
with the former option: exercising thought and care when we'd like to make something
act a certain way.

How much more thought and care must go into the design of a new kind of duck?
*Agile development* philosophy tells us to *do the simplest thing
that could possibly work* when faced with a challenging design task,
but this leaves several questions open:
1. What does it mean to *work*?
2. What sort of things *could possibly* work?
3. Among all conceivable solutions, which is *simplest*?
4. What does "*simplest*" even mean?

Of course real ducks were not designed: they are the product of countless generations of sexual reproduction and millions of years of environmental selection pressures. I don't have quite so much time, so instead I read, think, and write.
