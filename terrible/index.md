# Terrible Things

**This section contains rants.** You have been warned.

Do not expect a calm, rational, balanced look at the pros and cons of different alternatives.
Do not expect a cool, collected historical retrospective.

Expect flagrantly one-sided perspectives on different issues,
mainly related in some form or fashion to the
practice or business of software development.

Some of these perspectives may even disagree with one another.
