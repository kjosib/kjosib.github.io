# The Groupware of the (Idealized) Future

Let's face it. Organizational e-mail is a disgraceful tragedy. It doesn't matter if you're on Outlook, Notes, or a cloud-based solution. *They all suck.*

## The Problem

As an electronic interoffice memo, e-mail fits the bill. The problem is what we try to do with it.
A modern organization requires coordination, understanding, and distributed problem solving.
The transactional model of an interoffice memo is not well suited to that requirement.
Obviously work gets done in the presence of e-mail, but I claim it's *despite*, rather than *because of*.

## The Solution, in Abstract

We probably want something intermediate between a formal ticketing system and conventional e-mail.
When you fire off a note, you're looking for some combination of (a) action and (b) information,
which may itself lead to more action.
When you reply, it's either to provide information, deliverables, or commitment to action.
That means *the system* ought to model communication not as being *between people*,
but rather as *about topics/missions*, and to which various people may reasonably contribute in their ways.
It should keep track of questions, ideas, and action items;
track what's been responded and what's overdue;
and automatically flag down the right people when a process is stuck for any reason.
It should model the fact that some issues depend for their solution on others, or only seem to.
It should use that logic, along with organizational priorities,
to highlight the most important or valuable issues any given person can be working on just now.
And it should also tell you when your own pet projects are stuck behind a long list of higher priorities.

## Things I do not mean

There's a sense in which Google Wave was sort of like this. But only sort of.
You could add people to a "wave",
but this was more of a collaborative document than an intelligent work-front.

"Social media" is also not a proper model.
Sure you have a feed of posts and responses,
but there's no clear concept of an issue life-cycle.
Posts live until they are deleted, and they are never deleted,
so it's impossible to tell what to work on.

Actual ticketing systems as we currently understand them (e.g. *bugzilla* or *jira*)
are probably too formal and rigid.
They are designed around particular classes of work-flow (such as defect management)
but I expect users to define and refine process steps as they go along.

## Call to Action

Yeah, I'm not sure when yet. But maybe soon?
