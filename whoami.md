# Who am I to talk?

I've been coding pretty-much non-stop since about 1979 in a wide variety of languages,
paradigms, and systems. I've consistently refused to suffer needless tedium,
and insisted on learning something new with every project I take on.

My personal journey with *software as an industry* has been a bit unconventional. I have worked in
* a venture-capital-funded wild-west-style start-up, with a small group of social misfits.
* a stable boutique-style web-development firm proud of its e-learning as-a-service platform,
  with a larger group of around six dozen well-adjusted people.
* research-oriented special projects for my military unit,
  where I got to work on strange and wonderful algorithms with and for many of the smartest,
  kindest, and most inspiring people I may ever meet (and also a few stinkers).
* project control and financial reporting for a large petroleum-enginering task force,
  where both requirements and users were frequently changing over an eight-year time span.
* an international team in corporate investment banking,
  where stability is God and wrong-enough code can lose your yearly salary in a few seconds.

I'm also a bit of an egg-head for academic papers, articles, and new developments both in
computer science and the business of software.

I have developed a set of opinions thereby.

I am also blessed to have friends and relations in the same business.
I value their opinions highly, especially where their experience exceeds mine (which is frequently).

So I surely have some wrong ideas. But with any luck, they'll be better than random chance.
