# Project Kick-Off

Struggling to get a project off the ground?
Maybe it needs a kick.
Are you getting what you need from your project kick-off meetings?


## What For?

The kick-off sets the (initial) tone of the entire project to come.
Do it well, and you're off to a good start. And conversely.

A proper kick-off accomplishes (at least) several goals:

* The staff is revved up to perform and aligned on the mission.
* There's a clear and prominent record of:
	* The original goal, at least in overview.
	* The original concept of how to get there.
	* Big risks and major milestones.
	* Top-level outline of scope, schedule, and budget.
* Meaningful work can ramp up in earnest.

We commonly think of that brief retreat where the senior-most poobahs
huddle for a day, eat a catered lunch, and then declare that *it will be great,*
but that's far from the only session you need.

At each layer of communication (such as between team-lead and direct-contributor)
a localized kick-off meeting helps get things underway for that specific sub-unit of your organization
and its localized responsibilites that contribute to the larger project success.

Sometimes, you're recovering from missed steps.
Perhaps project stakeholders feel a bit in the dark.
Perhaps the project is a bit off the rails.
The form and substance of the kick-off may help you recover some lost momentum,
or at least find which way the rails might have gone without you.


## How To?

First, all the usual rules of meetings apply:
* Block out an appropriate amount of time.
* Invite the right people, and make sure they can pay attention.
  (That fellow with his mind on Fantasy Sportsball is going to scuttle your project, so fire him.)
* Set the right agenda. (A sample is below).
* Have someone *designated* to take the minutes/notes.
  (This, and the lead/facilitator, are the only person allowed to open their laptops.)
* Publish the results of the meeting in a proper place.

Because the kick-off is designed to align the momentum of a team,
you need immediate follow-up, loudly and with much fanfare,
to make sure everyone knows where to find the resulting artifacts.
And I do mean *everyone*, all the way from the executive sponsor to the high-school drop-out pushing a broom for minimum wage.
(Digression:
That drop-out makes it so we can work.
What's *our* best alternative to clean hallways?
Is he compensated accordingly?)

And again, you'll need another larger cycle of follow-up to make sure the effects stick across time and space.
See that your lieutenants are getting their own people aligned on mission accordingly.
Check back periodically, both vertically and horizontally, to see what needs to change,
and then make the appropriate changes loudly and with much fanfare.

Finally, if you're relatively new at this, or if the organization doesn't do this all the time,
then have a look at the section on related cultural issues and see what you might need to nail down.

## Sample Agenda:

What do we know about the Business Requirement?

* Definition of Success
  * By the way, now's the time to think about design life.
* Identity of Stakeholders:
  * Not just owners, but also
  * day-to-day operators
  * maintainers
  * construct/deploy/IT infrastructure people
  * developers/engineers/designers
  * incident-response team, for supportability
  * (maybe more?)
* Constraints:
  * Regulatory
  * Ethical
  * Technical
  * Budget
  * Scope
  * Schedule
  * Logistical
  * (maybe more?)

What definition and analysis has already been done?

* External System Boundary
* Transactions necessary to implement core functionality
* Operabilty, reliability, and monitoring concerns
* Size:
  * Data, Compute, Storage, Communications
  * Feed-stock Charateristics, Process-plant, Import/Export terminals
  * *Your industry here*
* General layout / breakdown / roadmap:
  * features and sub-features
  * systems and sub-systems
* Partners, colleagues, and vendors:
  * Points of contact
  * Service level agreements and responsiveness expectations
  * Multi-way interface agreements *(I need Alice and Bob to cooperate...)*
  * Specifications on deliverable artifacts and services
  * Scope of support after the fact
  * Any costs involved, or money changing hands
  * Logistical concerns


## Some related cultural issues

How do we keep this large project on track?

* A growing team requires an evolving management style.
* Dog-house, People-house, Apartment-complex, Skyscraper:
  * Larger projects require more than just grunt-level technical activity.
  * You can't solve all your problems with code anymore.
* The forecast: It needs to
  * exist, and everyone should see it.
  * change, and for the right reasons.
  * achieve more detail, as activities approach or complete.
* What fraction of efforts, on a continuous or periodic basis, will you devote to:
  * Refinining and scheduling the near-term forecast?
  * The same, but for intermediate term, and longer-term?
* How shall we measure and manage the schedule?
  * Take small bites.
  * Plan the work and work the plan.
  * Don't get too far ahead of yourself.
  * Lather, rinse, and repeat on a defined cadence.

How shall we communicate the forecast, schedule, and progress?

* The medium, and the nature of the message?
* Amongst ourselves or with external stakeholders?

What information composes the forecast?

* Hint: it's not just time-to-completion. *That would be the schedule.*
* The project's entire demands.
* Quantities and specifications of every component in the final deliverable.
* If you're in the software biz, remember: *We do not sell lines of code!*

What information composes the schedule and progress?

* On what scales shall we define blocks of work?
* At each scale:
  * Which blocks are in what status?
  * broadly speaking how fast are we moving?
  * Who all is working on which blocks right now?
  * What blocks are stuck or at schedule risk, and why?
  * What blocks require what other blocks complete before meaningful progress can begin?
