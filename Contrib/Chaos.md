# How I learned to stop worrying and love the chaos

*(Two points to anyone who catches the Kubrick reference.)*

**Abstract:** I know I want to communicate computing science (CS) and software engineering (SE).
Although I have sense there's appetite for this kind of thing, I don't know where to begin -- especially with YouTube
full of perfectly excellent seminars if you know how to look. To explore the problem space, I (plan to) conduct
surveys and focus groups with three main groups of stakeholders in the (local corporate) tech team:
junior programmers (to identify desire), senior/team-lead programmers (to sense need),
and the non-programnming local-executive staff (to peek over the horizon and align key objectives). Additionally,
I network through experienced contacts to drum up both venue and interest.
Results are %TOPIC% and %TOPIC% have the intersection of interest and need: After boning up on both,
presentations at %VENUE% and %VENUE% resulted in %NUMBER% attendees giving a "will use often" review rating.
One month and three months later, follow-up measures of the original senior/team-lead cohort reaveal %X% percent
improvement on seven-point Likert scale surveys of organizational performance along dimensions X, Y, and Z.

## Introduction

As an aspiring famous-person, it's easy to fall prey to one's own hubris and forget to do the hard work involved.
Famous in what way? *So glad you asked.* Technical communication influencer. I want to do this. I think we need it,
and I *will* find ways to make my contributions relevant, even if I have to crash a few gates in the process.

The [Five Gates of Implementation](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/78) generalize quite naturally to suggest a
sensibly-conservative approach to more things than code -- technical communication included.
But as George Bernard Shaw [pointed out](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/536961),
it takes a bit of unreasoning passion to make headway in bettering the status quo.

*I have that passion.* I also have a long history with computing science (CS) and software engineering (SE): some book-learning, and some practical.
What's in it for me personally is a lot of things. Yes, rewarding interpersonal connections are on that list
*(and why shouldn't they be?)* but also a connection between career and a higher purpose,
leading to a measure of [Self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization).

What I do not have *yet,* prior to completing the conceptual studies laid out in this paper,
is a clear plan of attack.

Therefore, the rest of this paper is my plan/forecast/actual retrospective -- laid out in advance --
of how I get the background knowledge necessary to make an effective stab at
doing the real aim of the game, which is to convey what knowledge and wisdom I can to a receptive next generation.

*And furthermore,* if I can forge a more institutionalized path for *everyone* to get more communicative
about the good, bad, and ugly of CS and SE, then I will consider *that* some next-level success.

## The Obstacle Course: Feedback Loops of *Talent* and *Content*

> If technical public-speaking were easy, everyone would be doing it.

For the moment, let me invoke the [Copernican Principle](https://www.thoughtco.com/copernican-principle-2699117)
and its extension to the corporate domain: any difference between my own experience and the average is most likely
due more to statistical variation than any special significance of my position, so the balance of extrinsic influence
is probably largely similar for most.

> At this point, and because I haven't been living under a *complete* rock,
> I know that some fraction of the audience now has intense thoughts of systemic bias at center-stage.
> Here at *$COMPANY*, we do not tolerate workplace discrimination.
> Your mileage may vary, but if membership in an *EEO protected-class* contributes to that variation,
> then I am compelled to refer the matter to HR for resolution.
> If there are any further questions about this policy, please ask HR.

> This has been a public service announcement. I will now return to my topic.

As I was saying, the view from my vantage point is that our business partners (internal customers)
are most liberal with praise in connection with getting today's immediate problem solved,
or with making progress on whatever development project is current that day.

What that means is that, despite the availability of resources by which someone might sharpen the proverbial saw,
for most programming jobs the typical daily grind in no way stimulates such saw-sharpening,
much less the development of public-speaking skills or relevant topics to share.

This sets up a chicken-and-egg problem for aspiring speakers.
There is no cheat-code or royal road,
but existing technical speakers demonstrate conclusively that there *must* be a way in somehow.

So much for problems. Let's see about solutions.

## Prior Art / Prevailing Conception

**The Corporate Speaking Circuit:**
The company where I currently work periodically runs internal seminar programs consisting of
many presentations in a brief timespan all related to a common theme.

Although I know a few people who've spoken on this circuit,
I've yet to get any solid data on how one might go about joining it.
Anecdotes follow, though:

**Kevin** spoke as part of a coordinated, themed technical seminar which my current employer periodically orchestrates.

Roughly paraphrased, he said it fell into his lap in a *right-place right-time* serendipity:
He was asked to speak on topic XYZ, and he spoke.

Unfortunately, this contact provides very little direct usable guidance:
opportunities do not simply land in your lap without considerable advance preparation,
whether carefully planned or intuitively executed.

**James** periodically explains new features in a certain internal development platform,
along with other assorted speaking engagements.

I need to follow up with him for data -- or for anecdote. (At this point, I'll take either.)

**The Local Biweekly Forum:**
There is a biweekly horizontal application-specific knowledge-transfer session in Houston.
It usually consists of a rotation of technical topics.
I've actually given a presentation on the topic of my team's product in this venue once before.
My experience with venue in the past, both as audience and presenter,
suggests that it's been treated like elementary-school book reports:
Most of the audience lacks the context to make meaningful connections with what gets presented.

**Vaguely Similar Efforts:**

Luc tried to stimulate organic knowledge-transfer among members of a certain group of teams.
His method seemed like crowd-sourcing ideas for how to do software engineering well.
It lasted for a while, but seems to have either fizzled out or gone beneath my radar.
If I had to guess, it probably succumbed to the aforementioned systemic incentives
for people to keep their heads down and just produce code. Still, I should follow
up to find out what really happened.

According to my own management, the London office is allegedly trying to reinstitute a
discussion forum about general software engineering techniques.
It's not 100% clear how well this is working,
but it sounds like it's been a real challenge to make it work.

## Approach / Methods / Solution

As [Bash≈ç tersely aludes,](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/26897)
the point is not merely to go before an audience and speak words.
A proper audience expects and deserves to acheive a state of catharsis through their experience of those words.
The performer's role is to steer that catharsis towards the kind of personal and professional growth the audience signed up for.

The approach to, and effectiveness of, such a cathartic state is outside the scope of this paper.
Rather, I am presently focused on working out:

- which topics and venues are the most propitious;
- how to book space, generate buzz, and drive audiences; and
- how to measure impact.

Nevertheless, preparation's technique is inseparable from its necessity under the circumstances,
so I will not rule out discussion of that aspect of the experience or lessons thereby learned.

### Starting Points

On the specific topic of getting into the game of public speaking,
there are four obvious places to start.
These are drawn from observations made prior to any systemic attempt.

I know of one person
who's actually given one of these presentations. By personal communication, I asked him about
how he got involved. 

**The Local Biweekly Forum:**
As mentioned under *prior art*, the local forum is not especially glamorous at the moment,
but the people who control it are easy to work with.
Recently, all the usual topics had been used up, and it came out that more general topics might be welcome from time to time.
It sounds like I just have to propose a topic and I'll be given a 30-minute speaking engagement.

**Toastmasters International:**
You can't say "public speaking" without someone *speaking up* and mentioning Toastmasters.
I've had many good and enriching experiences with Toastmasters on previous occasions.
Some companies sponsor chapters, and some even make it a standard part of management training.

**Everyone Who Will Listen:**
The unconventional option is to start bending every willing ear to the nature of my plan,
in hopes of developing a network of zealots (or at least believers) who can 
help make the right connections on appeal to the law of large numbers.

### Early Progress

After a quick and disappointing look into the *Toastmasters* angle,
I quickly pivoted to *Everyone Who Will Listen.*
That naturally includes *The Local Biweekly Forum,*
and by extension Srilatha, who controls its schedule.

Once I worked up the gumption to explain my mission and ask her directly for time on the schedule,
she was quite receptive to the idea.
It was only necessary to make some concession to her sense of what could and should be presented.
She'd just recently done some informal polling herself: the intersection of supply and demand
showed my best first topic to be an introductory overview of *$PRODUCT*, one of the company's
strategic platforms and one I'd accumulated over a year's direct experience with.

Having identified a topic, it was then necessary to organize an agenda.
The precise details are currently confidential, but in the abstract it
has roughly the structure I learned from the DOD's androgogy course.

As an early experiment with this agenda, I went over it with a new-hire.
That showed that, although I had a decent overall scope, I would need to add serious meat to the bones.
Thus, when I get back on Monday the plan is to expand in turn each major component of *$PRODUCT* to its own
sub-agenda following a simple formulaic plan. It might go like:

* Component
  * What problem it solves
  * Why this problem is worth solving
  * Approach to solution
  * Strength and weakness of the approach taken
  * Direct comparison to alternatives, if known
  * Surprises from experience with the component, if any
  * Where to find more information

I also applied this pattern in advance to the overall system before delving into subsystems.

## Results / Data / Findings / Proof / Discussion

This section is necessarily experiential: N=1 by definition.
As such, [no true statistician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)
should draw any definite conclusions about causality or even correlation.

### Opening Performance

On 4/20, I gave the presentation on the inaugural topic.
Intending to avoid death-by-powerpoint, I basically spoke from my notes.
Even moving quickly, I ran over time.
Still, there were some questions at the end specifically asking for some views.
So I did some screen-sharing in that moment.

Despite an early and prominent request for feedback, it has been slow coming.
About two weeks later, I did finally hear back from a member of the audience.
The respondent suggested:

1. visual aids,
2. demonstrations, and
3. fewer topics at a higher level.
   (I think he means more overview, less detail.)

To point 3, He gave an example concerning one of the subsystems of *$PRODUCT*:
He caught my explanation of *how it's used* but missed *how it's organized* and *why we have/use it.*
(I had a section for what problem the subsystem solves, but it may not have been clear.)

On 4/22, I did a retrospective on that initial "opening performance" with my manager from a career-development perspective.
That's how I learned about the present London-office effort to hold general software-engineering discussions.

## Interpretation / Significance

The first thing I learned is that visual aids are a much bigger deal than I initially estimated.
Each subtopic should have at least some kind of graphical element -- NOT merely words on a screen --
in order to amplify the nature of the problems and solutions I might be talking about.

It quickly became clear my topic was too broad for the alloted time.
As an introductory overview of a multifaceted platform with many major components,
it would probably make sense to drop the per-component *comparisons to alternatives* and
shrink the *approach to solution* sections, saving these for topical deep-dives.
Time saved could go toward some sort of demonstration.

Next, although I did put some audience participation early in the presentation,
it would probably help to have more. Perhaps each section could start with a question.

I may have fallen victim -- at least partially -- to an unfortunate pattern that currently
aflicts the biweekly knowledge share: What usually happens when someone gives an overview
of the system or technology they're working on is that people politely listen and then are
unable to use what they learned on the job any time soon, because whatever other project
has zero practical connection to their daily work. In my case I think I've upgraded
from *politely* to *curiously*, at least according to the avowed general interest in *$PRODUCT*,
but it still remains beyond the reach of your average technologist to take this new knowledge
and use it in their daily work. Honestly, the general population's interest in *$PRODUCT*
probably stems more from management excitement over what *$PRODUCT* offers,
rather than an immediate need to know the platform.

The retrospective highlighted a disconnect between content and purpose.
See, it's not enough to talk about what people think they want to hear about.
You make an impact with communication only when it changes the audience in a meaningful way,
such as by getting them to invest in a new technique or skill or really take any particular action.
(This goes back to the matter of catharsis I alluded to earlier.)
From my time in Toastmasters, I recognize this disconnect as contributing to another deficiency:
There is no particular *call to action* (to say nothing of *motivation to action*).
What's more, I failed to really even consider what action I want the audience to take
as a result of being my audience. Yes, there were pointers to more information,
and yes, someone might choose to follow those links. But that's far too thin to make a real impact.
The lesson may be that *agreeing to make a speech is agreeing to motivate people,*
so it's critical to determine what motivation is intended before composing the speech.
Mere brain-dumps are not very motivating.


## Future Steps

### Crossing Silos

Something interesting came out of the management retrospective.
We talked of trying to spread cross-cutting knowledge:
how to be a better software developer, for example.
And we mentioned a few possible approaches:

* Discussions
* Seminars
* Q&A sessions with panels of experts
* Periodically stirring the pot (transfering people around)

But the most relevant idea to my own journey relates to how we structure the expectations around knowledge transfer sessions.
As I mentioned, the status quo is that people give overviews and get a polite audience who then nods and goes back to work.
This represents its own new problem to solve.

To that end, I'd like to try to structure a talk around some useful principle or practice of software development.
The goal would be to motivate the audience to adopt or at least attempt the same principle in their own work.
There is a fundamental challenge here:
The [Chinese Doctor Parable](https://www.dynamicpoints.com/blog/bian-ques-older-brothers-and-treating-illness-before-it-occurs) applies in full force.
By the time the problems of ill practice are evident, it can take extraordinary efforts to recover.

A conventional dramatic arc does not center on tribulations avoided.
Rather, the motivation must be found some other way. Exactly *how* is my next question.

* I could find something that *has* turned around on my team's project, and play up the benefits as resulting from some change in practice.
* I could compare my experience on two projects with different practices; then play up the sounder one.
* I could engage the audience to get testimony that the problem aflicts many; then play up how the proper solution is working on my project.


### The Survey
At some point, I intend to have a reputation for being willing and able to speak on a decent variety of general-interest
software-development and comp-sci topics.
That creates a platform from which to also gather good data about needs and wants by driving traffic to a survey.

To that end, I've created a survey which I hope to adminster (currently as an appendix to this paper)
and I aim to get it into the corporate survey solution in the usual manner.
I'll soon create a brief agenda introducing the topic, opening the floor, facilitating discussion,
and then selling the idea that people please take the survey as a sanctioned contribution to the study I'm doing.

A few unconventional characteristics of the survey deserve mention:

* A more formally-designed survey might trace each survey question back to prior art or respected references.
  I'm relying on breadth of experience. I began with a brain-dump of everything I could think of which
  might influence the success and sustainability of a project. Then, I solicited feedback from a few
  carefully-selected, highly-trusted and qualified people to help fill any gaps.

* In the section where the respondent grades his/her project's performance,
  many of the questions include a sort of miniature rubric for how to score the issue.
  Contrary to what might be considered standard practice, I have intentionally phrased these to
  convey and promote certain value judgements about good and bad software engineering practices.
  
  I do this for several reasons which I believe are ethical, given proper expert review.
  One is to overcome apathy and stimulate action to improve matters.
  One is to overcome ignorance and stimulate a desire for learning.
  One is to overcome the assumption of agreement and stimulate focused debate on matters of substance to project success.
  
  The means and mechanism for expert review is built into the "advice and consent of the management"
  mentioned on the first screen of the survey. If I have any fundamental disagreements with management
  about what the ideal world looks like for a software engineering effort,
  then this becomes a blocking dependency.

In retrospect, the survey reads like a curriculum. 

### The Circuit
Perhaps I need to dig more into the corporate speaking circuit.
It's entirely possible -- likely even -- that a cadre of devoted people make their living
grooming and presenting speakers.


## Conclusion

This first experience has been a good and useful one, despite the lack of overt feedback.
It taught many lessons and opened new questions. It will take sustained hard work to break
into the ranks of regular speakers, but there's opportunity for the making.
The new questions demand answers, and to get them I'll have to perform more experiments
in the form of carefully-designed speeches. Perhaps in the progress some modicum of fame
may accrue; perhaps it does not. But I won't know until I try!
