# How I learned to stop worrying and love the chaos

*(Two points to anyone who catches the Kubrick reference.)*

**Abstract:** I know I want to communicate computing science (CS) and software engineering (SE).
Although I have sense there's appetite for this kind of thing, I don't know where to begin -- especially with YouTube
full of perfectly excellent seminars if you know how to look. To explore the problem space, I (plan to) conduct
surveys and focus groups with three main groups of stakeholders in the (local corporate) tech team:
junior programmers (to identify desire), senior/team-lead programmers (to sense need),
and the non-programnming local-executive staff (to peek over the horizon and align key objectives). Additionally,
I network through experienced contacts to drum up both venue and interest.
Results are %TOPIC% and %TOPIC% have the intersection of interest and need: After boning up on both,
presentations at %VENUE% and %VENUE% resulted in %NUMBER% attendees giving a "will use often" review rating.
One month and three months later, follow-up measures of the original senior/team-lead cohort reaveal %X% percent
improvement on seven-point Likert scale surveys of organizational performance along dimensions X, Y, and Z.

## Introduction

As an aspiring famous-person, it's easy to fall prey to one's own hubris and forget to do the hard work involved.
Famous in what way? *So glad you asked.* Technical communication influencer. I want to do this. I think we need it,
and I *will* find ways to make my contributions relevant, even if I have to crash a few gates in the process.

The [Five Gates of Implementation](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/78) generalize quite naturally to suggest a
sensibly-conservative approach to more things than code -- technical communication included.
But as George Bernard Shaw [pointed out](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/536961),
it takes a bit of unreasoning passion to make headway in bettering the status quo.

*I have that passion.* I also have a long history with computing science (CS) and software engineering (SE): some book-learning, and some practical.
What's in it for me personally is a lot of things. Yes, rewarding interpersonal connections are on that list
*(and why shouldn't they be?)* but also a connection between career and a higher purpose,
leading to a measure of [Self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization).

What I do not have *yet,* prior to completing the conceptual studies laid out in this paper,
is a clear plan of attack.

Therefore, the rest of this paper is my plan/forecast/actual retrospective -- laid out in advance --
of how I get the background knowledge necessary to make an effective stab at
doing the real aim of the game, which is to convey what knowledge and wisdom I can to a receptive next generation.

*And furthermore,* if I can forge a more institutionalized path for *everyone* to get more communicative
about the good, bad, and ugly of CS and SE, then I will consider *that* some next-level success.

## Prior Art / Prevailing Conception

- There are three obvious places to start, just from a sheer self-motivation perspective.

**The first** is the corporate speaking circuit.
No shade; I just need to learn those ropes.
I think Kevin can get me a kick in the right direction.
I'll talk with him Monday.

**The second** is the local horizontal knowledge-transfer sessions,
which might be repurposed from time to time.
Srilatha currently controls that schedule.
I shall follow up with her on Monday.

**The third** is to start telling everyone who will listen what my plan is,
in hopes of developing a network of zealots (or at least believers) who can 
help make the right connections on appeal to the law of large numbers.

- There is at least one similar effort I'm aware of.

Luc seems to have tried to stimulate organic knowledge-transfer among members of a certain group of teams.
I'm not sure how far that got. He's in another regional time zone, so I may not get to him on Monday,
but I'll definitely aim for early in the week.

- The *next level* is about the company's feedback loops (and metaloops) involving technical-speaking *talent* and *content*.

For the moment, let me invoke the [Copernican Principle](https://www.thoughtco.com/copernican-principle-2699117)
and its extension to the corporate domain: any difference between my own experience and the average is most likely
due more to statistical variation than any special significance of my position, so the balance of extrinsic influence
is probably largely similar for most.

> At this point, and because I haven't been living under a *complete* rock,
> I know that some fraction of the audience now has intense thoughts of systemic bias at center-stage.
> Here at _________, we do not tolerate workplace discrimination.
> Your mileage may vary, but if membership in an *EEO protected-class* contributes to that variation,
> then I am compelled to refer the matter to HR for resolution.
> If there are any further questions about this policy, please ask HR.

> This has been a public service announcement. I will now return to my topic.

As I was saying, the view from my vantage point is that our business partners (internal customers)
are most liberal with praise in connection with getting today's immediate problem solved,
or with making progress on whatever development project is current that day.

What that means is that, despite the availability of resources by which someone might sharpen the proverbial saw,
for most programming jobs the typical daily grind in no way stimulates such saw-sharpening,
much less the development of public-speaking skills or relevant topics to share.

Perhaps I just need to dig more into the corporate speaking circuit.
It's entirely possible -- likely even -- that a cadre of devoted people make their living
grooming and presenting speakers.

## Approach / Methods / Solution

As [Bash≈ç tersely aludes,](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/26897)
the point is not merely to go before an audience and speak words.
A proper audience expects and deserves to acheive a state of catharsis through their experience of those words.
The performer's role is to steer that catharsis towards the kind of personal and professional growth the audience signed up for.

The approach to, and effectiveness of, such a cathartic state is outside the scope of this paper.
Rather, I am presently focused on working out:

- which topics and venues are the most propitious;
- how to book space, generate buzz, and drive audiences; and
- how to measure impact.

**The Local Biweekly Forum:** There is a biweekly horizontal application-specific knowledge-transfer session in Houston.
Recently, all the usual topics had been used up, and it came out that more general topics might be welcome from time to time.
It sounds like I just have to propose a topic and I'll be given a 30-minute speaking engagement.

I could probably parley that into some good data about needs and wants by driving traffic to a survey web site,
while also facilitating a discussion of the interplay between software and engineering through such topics as
the [ACM code of professional ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)
or the development of engineering ethics as a phenomenon (which is historically recent).

To that end, and possibly eventually as an appendix to this paper, I'll create a brief agenda, the survey,
and maybe even a slide show that I can use to organize and orchestrate this first local information-gathering phase.

**Other Fora:** I'm actually not sure yet. This part is under construction, seeking mentorship.

## Appendix: Survey Questions

With the advice and consent of the management,
I'm trying to gather quantifiable data that will guide our future knowledge-transfer efforts.
Thank you for participating.

----

The first questions are about your personal skills and contributions to the near future of your current project.
If you lead a team, that will be on a separate screen.

1. What tool or technology would be most valuable for you to brush up on?
2. What aspect of the development life-cycle would be most valuable for you to learn more about?

----

These next questions relate to your current project. If you've recently changed projects,
please answer with respect to the project you're currently most familiar with.
I will *not* ask what project you're on. (I fear it might poison the data.)

To keep things simple, I'll ask for letter grades on each of several aspects of project execution:

* A: Excellent; exemplary.
* B: Good and respectable.
* C: Passable, but would benefit from improvement.
* D: Needs improvement badly.
* F: Fail.
* K: I am not well-enough skilled in this topic to evaluate our performance.
* N: I have no visibility into the team's approach to this.

----
* Mission and Vision: What makes this project special and worthwhile?
* Planning and Roadmap: Thinking up and evaluating possible future features or lines of development.
* Release Cadence: Do meaningful increments of business value go live regularly, or do technical obstacles slow the pace?
* Reliability: Does your product or service *just work,* or do you spend much time dealing with mistakes and breakdowns?
* Feasibility analysis:
  The economic sniff-test: Accounting for the costs and high-risk hurdles that might stymie project completion,
  balancing these against viable mitigations, and roughly estimating the likely ROI on implementing a concept.
* Architecture: The abstract plan to divide and conquer the overarching problem. Modular breakdown and overall approach to design.
* Design: Concrete *and understandable* solutions to specific, detailed subproblems.
* Engineering [Documentation](../documenting.md):
  The glue between specification, architecture, and design.
  Says what code can't.
  Helps all the internals make sense, so you don't have to remember.
* Procurement: Obtaining physical and logical resources on which to develop, test, or deploy the solution, service, or product.
* Deployment: Connecting, configuring, and installing the software on computing machines so that stuff physically works.
* Configuration Management: Keeping track of what versions of which artifacts are meant to be part of which release. Also, version control.
* Inter-Team Negotiation and Persuasion:
  For example, say your project has some new feature under development,
  which will also require Team XYZ to accomplish a task they might not otherwise do any time soon.
  How hard is it to achieve and recognize alignment on schedule and expectations between your combined sets of stakeholders?
* [Production/Operations Management](https://www.britannica.com/technology/production-management):
  In our context, I mean planning, control, execution, and administrative accountability
  for capacity, monitoring, support, and incident response.
* End-User Documentation: Can a person unfamiliar with the specifics of your product (a) figure out what to even look for, and (b) find it?
* End-User Support / Availabillity:
  Do people trivially find the help they need when they need it,
  or is it a long slog to find your inadequate homepage or contact list?
  Do new customers have to guess at how to properly request help or file a defect report?
* End-User Support / Boundaries:
  Do you clearly publish the boundaries on your scope of support?
  Have your customers understoood and agreed to these bounds?
  Does the support staff know how to say "no" when it's called for?
* End-User Support / Transparency:
  When you have a support interaction, do customers know what to expect and when, or does the squeaky wheel get the grease?
* End-User Support / Sustainability:
  Does each new customer increase your own burden? What about the overall collective burden imposed on the company stemming from that relationship?
* Operations Support: When something does go wrong, how quick and easy is it for trained personnel to notice, identify the cause, and fix the problem?
* Quality Assurance:
  Code test coverage is not enough.
  How do you know that the system does exactly what it's supposed to, even in weird rare corner cases?
* Project Control:
  Track, report, and analyze the plan, forecast, budget, schedule, scope, progress, effort, process, and changes to the above.
* Team member professional development: Are you getting better at this job, fast enough?
* Project Management:
  Sets goals/priorities, manages changes to scope/schedule/budget, allocates resources, and facilitates success.
  Primary focus is mission accomplishment on time, under budget, and with a satisfied customer.
* Product Management: Lives at the intersection of Business, UX, and Tech to invent, guide, and evolve the product.
  Primary focus is the grand vision and outside stakeholders.
* Intra-Team Communications: quantity, quality, tone, dignity, completeness, clarity, and frequency.
* Extra-Team Communications: quantity, quality, tone, dignity, completeness, clarity, and frequency.
* Technical Debt:
  Do you stay tightly factored, with functional cohesion and low coupling,
  or do you have bad copy-and-mutate with interlocking temporal dependencies?
  Can you understand your code declaratively from denotational semantics,
  or does it require tricky operational reasoning?
* Overall Process Maturity:
  For what fraction of our activities do we consistently follow a defined process?
  Do we periodically assess and evolve, or do we shoot from the hip?
* Stress Level / Vibe:
  Do you arrive happy, work in a calm and professional environment, and leave relaxed;
  or do you arrive anxious, fight fires in a culture of urgency and loud voices, and leave relieved?

Regardless of rank or pay bracket, on your project are you:

* Team Lead
* Senior Contributor
* Junior Contributor
* Other

----

If you are a Team Lead or Senior Contributor:

1. What do your more junior colleagues most need to improve on? (Free-form)
2. Why is this?
