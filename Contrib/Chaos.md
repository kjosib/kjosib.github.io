# How I learned to stop worrying and love the chaos

*(Two points to anyone who catches the Kubrick reference.)*

**Abstract:** I know I want to communicate computing science (CS) and software engineering (SE).
Although I have sense there's appetite for this kind of thing, I don't know where to begin -- especially with YouTube
full of perfectly excellent seminars if you know how to look. To explore the problem space, I (plan to) conduct
surveys and focus groups with three main groups of stakeholders in the (local corporate) tech team:
junior programmers (to identify desire), senior/team-lead programmers (to sense need),
and the non-programnming local-executive staff (to peek over the horizon and align key objectives). Additionally,
I network through experienced contacts to drum up both venue and interest.
Results are %TOPIC% and %TOPIC% have the intersection of interest and need: After boning up on both,
presentations at %VENUE% and %VENUE% resulted in %NUMBER% attendees giving a "will use often" review rating.
One month and three months later, follow-up measures of the original senior/team-lead cohort reaveal %X% percent
improvement on seven-point Likert scale surveys of organizational performance along dimensions X, Y, and Z.

## Introduction

As an aspiring famous-person, it's easy to fall prey to one's own hubris and forget to do the hard work involved.
Famous in what way? *So glad you asked.* Technical communication influencer. I want to do this. I think we need it,
and I *will* find ways to make my contributions relevant, even if I have to crash a few gates in the process.

The [Five Gates of Implementation](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/78) generalize quite naturally to suggest a
sensibly-conservative approach to more things than code -- technical communication included.
But as George Bernard Shaw [pointed out](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/536961),
it takes a bit of unreasoning passion to make headway in bettering the status quo.

*I have that passion.* I also have a long history with computing science (CS) and software engineering (SE): some book-learning, and some practical.
What's in it for me personally is a lot of things. Yes, rewarding interpersonal connections are on that list
*(and why shouldn't they be?)* but also a connection between career and a higher purpose,
leading to a measure of [Self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization).

What I do not have *yet,* prior to completing the conceptual studies laid out in this paper,
is a clear plan of attack.

Therefore, the rest of this paper is my plan/forecast/actual retrospective -- laid out in advance --
of how I get the background knowledge necessary to make an effective stab at
doing the real aim of the game, which is to convey what knowledge and wisdom I can to a receptive next generation.

*And furthermore,* if I can forge a more institutionalized path for *everyone* to get more communicative
about the good, bad, and ugly of CS and SE, then I will consider *that* some next-level success.

## Prior Art / Prevailing Conception

- There are three obvious places to start, just from a sheer self-motivation perspective.

**The first** is the corporate speaking circuit.
No shade; I just need to learn those ropes.
I think Kevin can get me a kick in the right direction.
I'll talk with him Monday.

**The second** is the local horizontal knowledge-transfer sessions,
which might be repurposed from time to time.
Srilatha currently controls that schedule.
I shall follow up with her on Monday.

**The third** is to start telling everyone who will listen what my plan is,
in hopes of developing a network of zealots (or at least believers) who can 
help make the right connections on appeal to the law of large numbers.

- There is at least one similar effort I'm aware of.

Luc seems to have tried to stimulate organic knowledge-transfer among members of a certain group of teams.
I'm not sure how far that got. He's in another regional time zone, so I may not get to him on Monday,
but I'll definitely aim for early in the week.

- The *next level* is about the company's feedback loops (and metaloops) involving technical-speaking *talent* and *content*.

For the moment, let me invoke the [Copernican Principle](https://www.thoughtco.com/copernican-principle-2699117)
and its extension to the corporate domain: any difference between my own experience and the average is most likely
due more to statistical variation than any special significance of my position, so the balance of extrinsic influence
is probably largely similar for most.

> At this point, and because I haven't been living under a *complete* rock,
> I know that some fraction of the audience now has intense thoughts of systemic bias at center-stage.
> Here at _________, we do not tolerate workplace discrimination.
> Your mileage may vary, but if membership in an *EEO protected-class* contributes to that variation,
> then I am compelled to refer the matter to HR for resolution.
> If there are any further questions about this policy, please ask HR.

> This has been a public service announcement. I will now return to my topic.

As I was saying, the view from my vantage point is that our business partners (internal customers)
are most liberal with praise in connection with getting today's immediate problem solved,
or with making progress on whatever development project is current that day.

What that means is that, despite the availability of resources by which someone might sharpen the proverbial saw,
for most programming jobs the typical daily grind in no way stimulates such saw-sharpening,
much less the development of public-speaking skills or relevant topics to share.

Perhaps I just need to dig more into the corporate speaking circuit.
It's entirely possible -- likely even -- that a cadre of devoted people make their living
grooming and presenting speakers.

## Approach / Methods / Solution

As [Bash≈ç tersely aludes,](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/26897)
the point is not merely to go before an audience and speak words.
A proper audience expects and deserves to acheive a state of catharsis through their experience of those words.
The performer's role is to steer that catharsis towards the kind of personal and professional growth the audience signed up for.

The approach to, and effectiveness of, such a cathartic state is outside the scope of this paper.
Rather, I am presently focused on working out:

- which topics and venues are the most propitious;
- how to book space, generate buzz, and drive audiences; and
- how to measure impact.

**The Local Biweekly Forum:** There is a biweekly horizontal application-specific knowledge-transfer session in Houston.
Recently, all the usual topics had been used up, and it came out that more general topics might be welcome from time to time.
It sounds like I just have to propose a topic and I'll be given a 30-minute speaking engagement.

I could probably parley that into some good data about needs and wants by driving traffic to a survey web site,
while also facilitating a discussion of the interplay between software and engineering through such topics as the ACM code of professional ethics
or the development of engineering ethics as a phenomenon (which is historically recent).

To that end, and possibly eventually as an appendix to this paper, I'll create a brief agenda, the survey,
and maybe even a slide show that I can use to organize and orchestrate this first local information-gathering phase.
