# Reading List for Software Developers / "Engineers"

I'm assuming you are reasonably fluent in some general-purpose programming language,
and you can make it do a decent variety of cute tricks.
If that's not true yet, probably read this edition of
[How to think like a computer scientist](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/).
In fact, read that anyway if you're new-ish to the field -- say, less than a few years experience.

Edsger Dijkstra infamously quipped that software engineering is *how to program when you cannot*.
I do believe that software can be an engineered product, but often it is merely designed.
A good place to start, though, is with his treatise on programming:
[EWD 249](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD249.PDF)

David L Parnas's seminal contribution on modularity:
[On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules](https://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/edu/2ip30/references/criteria_for_modularization.pdf).
TL;DR: Separate *concerns*, not *jobs*, and you will do reasonably well.

* The proper domain of a module is abstract data types and the operations among them.
There's a paper I mean to track down which explains this.

Anyone concerned with concurrency should read Charles Anthony R. Hoare's article
[Communicating Sequential Processes](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare78.pdf).

I will add to this list as things occur to me.
