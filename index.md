# ðŸ”® Imagine a glossy banner here. ðŸ”®

Feel your cheeks ripple in the wind as you ride the roller-coaster down gracefully sloping curves of a cursive logo with just the right kerning to keep the wheels tracking at the ligatures. Cling to your equilibrium as you make the loop around the top of a capital letter and the whole world is briefly upside-down, then screaming towards you, and WHOOSH as the calligrapher flourishes a descender.

Now that you are properly refreshed, enjoy the rest this brochure at a more leisurely pace.

# âœ¨ Let's blow up the universe! âœ¨

Some ideas at the far reaches of deep design-space in computing may, if brought too close to our familiar reality, pose the speculative risk of igniting a false-vacuum transition to bring the entire industry to a lower energy state with completely different empirical characteristics. They may also be just plain bonkers.

* [Computer Programs as Databases, not Plain Text](Universe/code_db.md)
* [Tabs and Spaces are Both Broken: It's time for Encapsulated Text.](Universe/tab_space.md)
* [The Groupware of the Future](Universe/groupware.md)
