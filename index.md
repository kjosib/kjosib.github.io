# ðŸ”® Imagine a glossy banner here. ðŸ”®

Feel your cheeks ripple in the wind as you ride the roller-coaster down gracefully sloping curves of a cursive logo with just the right kerning to keep the wheels tracking at the ligatures. Cling to your equilibrium as you make the loop around the top of a capital letter and the whole world is briefly upside-down, then screaming towards you, and WHOOSH as the calligrapher flourishes a descender.

Now that you are properly refreshed, enjoy the rest this brochure at a more leisurely pace.

# ðŸ¦† Perfectly Reasonable Ideas ðŸ¦†

The essays, homilies, and ravings linked here address some of my own [ducks](make_duck.md).
I make no claim to perfection: evolution is still possible, and feedback is encouraged.

* [How to Make a Duck](make_duck.md) (Slightly allegorical.)
* [Error-Reporting for Humans](error_reporting.md)
* [Writing Documentation](documenting.md)
* [Interviewing: From a new-ish hiring manager's perspective](interviewing.md)
* [Thoughts on Code Quality](code_quality.md)
* [Agile, the Great and Terrible](agile_the_terrible.md)
* [Requirements Capture and Tracking for Humans](requirements.md)
* *More to come, eventually.*

Some ideas at the far reaches of deep design-space in computing may, if brought too close to our familiar reality, pose the speculative risk of igniting a false-vacuum transition to bring the entire industry to a lower energy state with completely different empirical characteristics. They may also be just plain bonkers.

* [Computer Programs as Databases, not Plain Text](code_db.md)
* [Tabs and Spaces are Both Broken: It's time for Encapsulated Text.](tab_space.md)
* Automated reasoning assistance for evidence and belief in uncertain propositions
* We're (probably) doing self-driving cars completely wrong.
