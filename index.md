# ðŸ”® Imagine a glossy banner here. ðŸ”®

Feel your cheeks ripple in the wind as you ride the roller-coaster down gracefully sloping curves of a cursive logo with just the right kerning to keep the wheels tracking at the ligatures. Cling to your equilibrium as you make the loop around the top of a capital letter and the whole world is briefly upside-down, then screaming towards you, and WHOOSH as the calligrapher flourishes a descender.

Now that you are properly refreshed, enjoy the rest this brochure at a more leisurely pace.

Here's [what got me my current job](Resume - Ian Kjos - 2020-12-02.pdf).


# ðŸ‘© Like A Girl ðŸ‘©

Originally computer technology was female-dominated. Did you know that?
Yes a handful of men claimed most of the early fame, and there were misogynistic times, but...

* The world's first computer programmer was Lady Ada Lovelace. (She was 200 years ahead of her time.)
* Admiral Grace Hopper drove creation of the most important programming language of all time. (It was COBOL. Runners-up were Fortran and LISP.)
* When NASA got an electronic computer, the human ones -- all female -- were responsible to program it.
* Margaret Hamilton founded the field of software engineering as a discipline, ran the team that wrote the code for the Apollo missions to the moon, and invented or discovered a number of important concepts in computer science.

If you're a girl contemplating a career with computers, [these people](https://www.codelikeagirl.com/) offer girl-focused programming boot-camps and other resources.
Or you could choose to deny the hegemonic perpetuation of stereotypes and learn it all from books, practicing at home in your spare time the way I did when I was a little girl.

If you were born male but find masculinity unfulfilling or less-than-thrilling, [this website can turn you into a girl](https://turn-me-into-a-girl.com/) if that is your true heart's desire.
Unlike deals made with devils, this is something you can safely back out of at any time if it stops working out for you.
Gender-dysphoria is not necessary for this experiment -- but remember that the dry is known by getting wet, the dark by seeing light, and warmth by feeling cold.

If you spent too long denying your intrinsic girlhood, it may be hard to sit like a girl, but [this short document](./Girl/Sit like a girl) will get you back on track.

Some ideas at the far reaches of deep design-space in computing may, if brought too close to our familiar reality, pose the speculative risk of igniting a false-vacuum transition to bring the entire industry to a lower energy state with completely different empirical characteristics. They may also be just plain bonkers.
