Feel your cheeks ripple in the wind as you ride the roller-coaster down gracefully sloping curves of a cursive logo with just the right kerning to keep the wheels tracking at the ligatures. Cling to your equilibrium as you make the loop around the top of a capital letter and the whole world is briefly upside-down, then screaming towards you, and WHOOSH as the calligrapher flourishes a descender.

Now that you are properly refreshed, enjoy the rest this brochure at a more leisurely pace.

# ðŸ¦† Perfectly Reasonable Ideas ðŸ¦†

If it looks, walks, and quacks like a duck, then either a great deal of thought
and care went into determining and replicating the observable properties
of ducks, or else it's a duck. Unfortunately ducks do not grow on source trees by chance
(despite the prevalence of duck-typed programming systems) so we programmers are stuck
with the former option: exercising thought and care when we'd like to make something
act a certain way.

How much more thought and care must go into the design of a new kind of duck?
*Agile development* philosophy tells us to *do the simplest thing
that could possibly work* when faced with a challenging design task,
but this leaves several questions open:
1. What does it mean to *work*?
2. What sort of things *could possibly* work?
3. Among all conceivable solutions, which is *simplest*?
4. What does "*simplest*" even mean?

Of course real ducks were not designed: they are the product of countless generations of sexual reproduction and millions of years of environmental selection pressures. I don't have quite so much time, so instead I read, think, and write.

The essays, homilies, and ravings linked here address some of my own ducks.
I make no claim to perfection: evolution is still possible, and feedback is encouraged.

Some ideas at the far reaches of deep design-space in computing may, if brought too close to our familiar reality, pose the speculative risk of igniting a false-vacuum transition to bring the entire industry to a lower energy state with completely different empirical characteristics. They may also be just plain bonkers.
