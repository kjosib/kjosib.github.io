# On Masculinity

The red-pillers do get all the media attention, don't they? As an older-than-average TF myself I look at a few major categories of what I'm rejecting about masculinity. Maybe that perspective fits your curiosity.

1. Gendered presentation. That covers dress, grooming, mannerisms, modes of speech, etc. The Men's Wearhouse slogan was "You're going to love the way you look. I guarantee it." Well, I never did. I mean I could do the masculine look with some skill, but I got absolutely no emotional satisfaction from it. But put me in girly stuff and I'm in heaven.
2. Social groups and activities. Stereotypically speaking, I have no interest in football, hunting, or changing the head-gasket in a '57 Chevy pickup. Yes I learned a decent amount about these topics, but Ryan Gosling is hot -- stereotypically speaking, again.
3. Secondary sex characteristics. I'll admit brute strength has its uses, but I've always wanted to be the size and shape of a woman. If I need force I'll pick up a damn lever.
4. Social privilege. The masculine gender has traditionally been afforded more prestige in my culture, although that's changing. Male speech often goes first and unchallenged. I'll live.
5. The balance between emotion and logic or reason. Humans need both, and to be understood on both fronts, but traditional western masculinity tends to suppress emotional things. I'd rather feel my feelings.
