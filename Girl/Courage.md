# Courage

Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is the will to press forward despite fear.

Like a muscle, courage can be trained and exercised and cultivated to grow, although too much too quickly can lead to injury.

The ancient Roman poet Virgil gives us the proverb declares "Fortune favors the bold."
However, fortune is also fickle: There are no guarantees in life.
The only thing we can do is observe, estimate, calculate, decide, and execute.
Oh, and feel some pretty intense feelings along the way.
