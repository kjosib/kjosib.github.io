# How to sit like a girl:

I found after 48 years of pretending to be male, that I'd lost the flexibility to sit crosslegged like a woman --- but once I stretched out my hip abductors, the tension went away and now it's an easy way to look more femme anywhere sitting is called for.

You might be able to fix it in a day with carefully targetted stretching.

Stand with feet a bit more than shoulder-width apart. Thrust your hips out to the right as far as you can, and lean the rest of your body over to the left. Otherwise, try to stay in a plane. You'll feel a stretch on the side of your right hip. Consciously try to relax that muscle and stretch, but *DO NOT* go to pain. It may help to bend your right knee slightly as you sink into the stretch. Hold for 30-60 seconds, whatever you can manage. Then do the other side. Now try to sit like a girl.

Once I discovered this stretch (which I kind of invented intuitively) I was able to sit girl-style immediately.
However, I'd also been stretching some other ways, so your mileage may vary. In any case, this should help a lot.

The great thing is the looser abductors stays with you, and the crossed-legs becomes a way to keep the newfound flexibility.
