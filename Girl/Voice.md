# How I *finally* found a feminine voice

8 September 2024

Nothing was working. I was stuck in a rut, able to get *farther from,* but not *closer to* anything remotely feminine.

Everyone in the trans community focused on *sound qualities and mimicry,* but nobody said a word about *how to physically do the thing.* Also, some of the guidance I tried to follow was just flat backwards, especially regarding the audio spectra of fem/masc voices. Well, that changed over the last few days: I said "fuck it, I'm going to explore the proprioception angle" and also finally unmasked the disinformation about spectrograms I'd accidentally swallowed. Also, someone showed me [how to make Windows 10 play the microphone back into the headphones](https://www.cyberacoustics.com/how-to-get-microphone-playback-windows-10). (Fair warning: Every time you reconnect your headphones, you'll have to uncheck, apply, check, apply. Also, there is a 1/4-second delay over USB.)

Ten minutes later I had the neural pathways built to complete a feedback loop between intention, execution, result, and adjustment. Initially that was with the aid of the spectrogram (search "Friture") because the initial stages of exploration sound so unnatural that they give no intuition for what to change next, but I got to the point of hearing the effects of the different adjustments. In the next 30 minutes, I got to the point of being able to reach a reasonably-fem configuration. The following evening I had a voice that *passed to myself* which admittedly still takes work to find and doesn't last forever, but I'm getting better at finding and maintaining the voice and *feel a sense of progress*. (I've yet to try it on the phone, but got a tremendous hit of gender euphoria, which is the real point.)

I should mention that I've since discovered that TransVoiceLessons posted some inside-the-mouth
videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcetsAEBSrc)
and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jixU7d0FwZw) --
watch these in order -- and you'll get a good sense of the physicality.

## Mental tips:

* Don't stress out. Treat this like play, not a chore. You're learning a high-level task involving fine-motor coordination with muscles that you've probably never consciously controlled before. It's kind of like handwriting: Tolerable penmanship takes months or years to develop in a child. And children are *genius* at picking up new skills. And you can *see* the pen and the results in fine detail, whereas "vocal gender" is an abstract judgement normally on a subconscious level.
* Progress comes in fits and starts. A sense of pressure to *get this now* will be counterproductive and even cause backsliding. There will be down days, and that's normal. You'll get knocked down, but you'll get up again. They're never gonna keep you down. (Thank you, Chumba Wumba!)

## Physical tips:

* Don't overwork your voice. Nothing should *hurt,* but it does take time to develop endurance. Your voice will need good rest between sessions, just like with developing any other muscle group.
* Drink ***lots*** of water. It is *insane* how much water I drink while voice training. I feel the need to pee every 45-60 minutes.
* If you feel like coughing, don't! Take a sip of water instead.

## Plan A: The most time-efficient approach

1. Spend a little money on a well-qualified coach who understands and respects the science while keeping a good bedside-manner.

* Problem: They aren't all qualified to the same degree, and it's hard for a lay-person to tell the difference.

## Plan B: The DIY approach

Everyone starts out with a different constellation of skills, sub-skills, and sub-sub-skills on different levels.
Understand what you have so far, then build towards your goal in achievable increments.
Eventually, forget the lower-levels because they become automatic and no longer require conscious control.

Learning a motor skill means reshaping the segment of your brain responsible for converting intention into muscle-control signals.
(Brains are constantly reshaping themselves according to the demands placed upon them. It gets more difficult in adulthood, but not impossible by any stretch.)


For each motor-skill to be learned, build a control system (a.k.a. feedback cycle):

1. Intention activates the motor cortex.
2. The motor cortex interprets that into a collection of outbound signals bound for specific muscles.
3. The muscles do their thing (assuming they're able)
4. Something moves in your body.
5. That impacts the external *and internal* environment.
6. Sensing cells detect the changes to the environment.
7. Signals from the senses reach your brain.
8. Your brain interprets and evaluates the signal.
9. You decide to do more or less of the thing.
10. Go back to step one.


* Also, supervise the process: Is it moving you towards having the constellation of skills you desire? Does it need adjustment? 

If something is *hard* to learn, that's normal enough: This stuff takes time!
But if it *seems impossible,* then one or more of the above steps is not functioning as desired.
So we can diagnose the control loop, and then take whatever measures we can until it's functioning well enough.

### Intervening with the intention:

We often start without knowing what to even *try* to command our bodies to do.
For some of the higher-level skills, you may save a lot of time by mimicking cartoon voices and then isolating specific components of that behavior.

[New York Vocal Coaching](https://www.youtube.com/user/NewYorkVocalCoaching) is a great resource for learning mimicry in detail,
and they have some approachable videos on a number of technical aspects too. Their catalog teaches a lot more than you need.

If you just want to cut to the chase:

* The paragon of vocal masculinity, [Walter Cronkite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5tdqojA26E): High (masc) weight, large (masc++) size.
* Sponge-Bob Square-Pants: High (masc) weight, Small (fem) size, middle pitch, masc-leaning pronunciation.
* Patrick Star: Low (fem) weight, Extra-large (masc++) size.
* Stereotypical near-whispering easy-listening radio DJ: Low (fem) weight, large (masc++) size, masculine articulation, lilting intonation.
* Stereotypical "gay man on television": High (masc) weight, large (masc++) size, fem-leaning pronunciation.
* Bart Simpson: Low (fem) weight, Small (fem) size, boyish pronunciation.

If you can do these voices convincingly, then you have all the sub-skills to craft a *passing* fem voice.
The main problem will be coordinating specific combinations of sub-skill behaviors.
That is again just another motor skill. The same basic *control-system* framework applies.

**Pronunciation** is a special challenge: it goes by so quick we don't know what to *intend*.
It can help to play contrasting recordings very slowly (say, 1/5th speed) in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
in order to pay careful attention to the differences between gendered pronunciation.
Then imitate at a similar slow speed until it's naturalized.
Slowly get faster, but check your progress with recordings.

### Intervening with the motor cortex:

The motor cortex does not yet know what to do with your intention.
It may then do *random* things or even *nothing at all,* which is the most frustrating.

Whether you're trying to learn an unfamiliar *muscle* or an unfamiliar *pattern*, the approach is basically similar.


**Random things:**
Slow down significantly. Relax. Focus on control over one specific movement or element. Try to isolate control over that.
Divide and conquer: Treat this as a new, smaller challenge.

**Nothing at all:**
Try other intentions until somehow, by accident, the target movement moves -- even if it comes along with random other things.
Now again, slow down and focus on trying to relax out the other moving parts.

Common "other intentions" include doing the *opposite* motion and various tricks that *incidentally* result in the desired motion.
Either of these may give the motor cortex enough of a kick to start building a control path.

At this point, you now have a foothold. Continued practice over time will yield results.

### Intervening with the environment:

First, make sure you are safe, well-rested, and your physical needs are met.
Otherwise, it will be impossible to focus and then learning can't happen.

There's also no substitute for a quiet place with some soft furnishings to dampen harsh echoes.

### Intervening with the senses:

With speech, the primary form of feedback is how something sounds.
But hearing *oneself* is different from hearing *someone else* because sound also resonates internal to the body.
We're used to compensating for this in our current day-to-day voice, but most likely not the new voice.
Therefore, we must use training wheels until that compensation develops.

The best training wheels are a good headset with real-time microphone feedback.
If that's out of reach, there's generally a way to activate software feedback on a computer.
Apparently also [Open Broadcaster Software | OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
has a setting for that. The problem -- at least on windows -- is that software imposes a small delay in the feedback,
which is less good for training the neural pathways.

* Place your mic in front of your chin or beside your cheek so wind-noise from your breath does not foul the signal you're trying to engineer.

It's also possible to learn to read a spectrogram. However, that's a skill in its own right.
This is very indirect, substituting visual for auditory information.
It can help with certain things, but it's a specialized tool.
If you're interested, play around with [Friture](https://friture.org/).
Just don't get too wrapped up nitpicking sound spectra.
In the end, what matters is how the *human* auditory system evaluates the sound.

Finally, let us not discount proprioception. Some in the trans-voice community consider this a heresy,
but it is possible to feel certain things associated with *some aspects* of vocal posture.
You might not feel *the actual structure itself,* but you may feel *some other thing* that acts by proxy.
The most obvious example is larynx position: You can feel the so-called "Adam's Apple" moving up and down.
The Adam's Apple is not the larynx per se, but it's attached via cartilage. Where one goes, the other follows.
It makes a great proxy. The problem is that this can be *too powerful.* Complete voluntary control over
larynx *height* can let you ram it into other vocal structures and not feel the damage you're doing,
even while struggling to achieve results because you actually need to be actuating more structures in concert.
So if you go down this road, be careful. It's a dark art.

### Intervening with the interpretation:

We may sound *weird* to ourselves but *perfectly cromulent* to someone else,
just because we're not used to hearing ourselves sound that way.
Also, dysphoria and frustration can get in the way.

* The auditory experience can be deeply confusing until you gain enough coordination to hold a throat configuration and start to vary other things: People don't gender a droning monotone; they gender speech.

Periodically, take recordings and play them back after a short rest.
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is suitable for this and popular, although it has many features and thus takes a bit of learning.
If you want something simpler, Windows has a "voice recorder" tool built in.
Others probably have something similar.

Get feedback from other people. Ideally, people who know what they're talking about on a technical level.
Eventually, you'll need and want to develop your own ear for the technical components of a voice.

You can also listen to voice clips demonstrating particular features from some of the more prolific voice coaches online.

It's a good idea to keep some sample recordings around of how you sounded at different points in your journey.


## Size/Resonance tips:

* Most people talk of raising the larynx. This is only part of the resonance picture, and maybe a false-start for feminizing. For shrinking the resonant cavity in the throat, it's much more important to gain control of the OPC muscles in the back of the throat. After that, the larynx will generally do the right thing reflexively, but you can adjust it a *little bit* to fine-tune a resonance that's basically in the right ballpark. Under voluntary control, one can easily raise the larynx too hard and cause harm over time.
* Get some control over weight first. I got there with mimicry of the Patrick-Star / Yogi-Bear voice, but a better example might be the stereotypical smooth-jazz radio annoucer. It doesn't need to be great; just middling so you don't end up sounding like a Sponge-Bob when you achieve fem resonance.

* ***The real trick*** for fem resonance is the the ***diameter*** of the vocal tract at each point along its length. I'm about to commit heresy by writing this, but here goes:
   * Chewed food passing through the throat moves by peristalsis: a progressions of muscular structures close *behind* the food to push it towards the esophagus and eventually the stomach.
   * These muscles include many distinct parts of the tongue (which extends all the way down the back of your throat until the esophagus) and another set of voluntary/skeletal muscles that line the back of the throat behind the soft palate. You need to find them in your perception and get a feel for moving them at will.
   * With the proper biofeedback (i.e. microphone feedback and a 2-D spectrogram) you can quickly gain voluntary control over the parts before the esophagus. Play with how it feels to flex or relax each muscle. Move it smoothly and slowly from relaxed to flexed and back. Each will have a distinctive impact on how sound energy is absorbed or amplified in different frequency ranges.
   * With the spectrogram running and a sustained monotone "AAAAA" sound at around 160 or 200 Hz, you can dial in a configuration which will at least be in the ballpark, and then get a sense of how each part changes the sound when it's allowed to vary. At that point, you'll be on the way to developing a usable voice.
   * An important goal is to 
   * Fem resonance will distribute energy fairly evenly into most of the harmonics up through at least 4-5 kHz. (this is why 8k samples-per-second is minimum for telephone-quality audio.) A strong taper-down between the fundamental and around 2 kHz is characteristic of masculine resonance: it emphasizes the perception of lower tones.

* An intermediate step before articulate speech is to let the monotone develop into an erotic moan. That can also help drop out excessive weight. Also it's great fun. You may start to perceive the gendered characteristics of the new voice, which is a triple whammy:
   1. You get a +5 bonus to Gender Euphoria for the evening.
   2. \[Censored.\]
   3. Reinforcement learning will happen at a deep level.

## Last Words:

* Remember: Aim for ***COMFORT*** and *to lose the training wheels!*
