# How I *finally* found a feminine voice

8 September 2024

Nothing was working. I was stuck in a rut, able to get *farther from,* but not *closer to* anything remotely feminine.

Everyone focused on *sound qualities and mimicry,* but nobody said a word about *how to physically do the thing.* Also, some of the guidance I tried to follow was just flat backwards, especially regarding the audio spectra of fem/masc voices. Well, that changed over the last few days: I said "fuck it, I'm going to explore the proprioception angle" and also finally unmasked the disinformation about spectrograms I'd accidentally swallowed. Also, someone showed me [how to make Windows 10 play the microphone back into the headphones](https://www.cyberacoustics.com/how-to-get-microphone-playback-windows-10). (Fair warning: Every time you reconnect your headphones, you'll have to uncheck, apply, check, apply. Also, there is a 1/4-second delay over USB.)

Ten minutes later I had the neural pathways built to complete a feedback loop between intention, execution, result, and adjustment. Initially that was with the aid of the spectrogram (search "Friture") because the initial stages of exploration sound so unnatural that they give no intuition for what to change next, but I got to the point of hearing the effects of the different adjustments. In the next 30 minutes, I got to the point of being able to reach a reasonably-fem configuration. The following evening I had a voice that *passed to myself* which admittedly still takes work to find and doesn't last forever, but I'm getting better at finding and maintaining the voice and *feel a sense of progress*. (I've yet to try it on the phone, but got a tremendous hit of gender euphoria, which is the real point.)

More tips:

* Don't overwork your voice. Nothing should *hurt,* but it does take time to develop endurance. Your voice will need good rest between sessions, just like with developing any other muscle group.
* Place your mic in front of your chin, not your mouth, so the passing rush of air doesn't foul the signal you're trying to engineer.
* Most people talk of raising the larynx. This is a red herring. The larynx will generally do the right thing reflexively, but you can adjust it a *little bit* to fine-tune a resonance that's basically in the right ballpark.
* Get some control over weight first. I got there with mimicry of the Patrick-Star / Yogi-Bear voice. It doesn't need to be great; just middling so you don't end up sounding like a Sponge-Bob when you achieve fem resonance.
* ***The real trick*** for fem resonance is the the ***diameter*** of the vocal tract at each point along its length. I'm about to commit heresy by writing this, but here goes:
   * Chewed food passing through the throat moves by peristalsis: a progressions of muscular structures close *behind* the food to push it towards the esophagus and eventually the stomach.
   * These muscles include many distinct parts of the tongue (which extends all the way down the back of your throat until the esophagus) and another set of voluntary/skeletal muscles that line the back of the throat behind the soft palate. You need to find them in your perception and get a feel for moving them at will.
   * With the proper biofeedback (i.e. microphone feedback and a 2-D spectrogram) you can quickly gain voluntary control over the parts before the esophagus. Play with how it feels to flex or relax each muscle. Move it smoothly and slowly from relaxed to flexed and back. Each will have a distinctive impact on how sound energy is absorbed or amplified in different frequency ranges.
   * With the spectrogram running and a sustained monotone "AAAAA" sound, you can dial in a configuration which will at least be in the ballpark, and then get a sense of how each part changes the sound when it's allowed to vary. At that point, you'll be on the way to developing a usable voice.
   * Fem resonance will distribute energy fairly evenly into most of the harmonics up through at least 4-5 kHz. (this is why 8k samples-per-second is minimum for telephone-quality audio.) A strong taper-down between the fundamental and around 2 kHz is characteristic of masculine resonance: it emphasizes the perception of lower tones.
* The auditory experience can be deeply confusing until you gain enough coordination to hold a resonant configuration and start to vary other things: People don't gender a droning monotone; they gender speech.
* An intermediate step before articulate speech is to let the monotone develop into an erotic moan. That can also help drop out excessive weight. Also it's great fun. You may start to perceive the gendered characteristics of the new voice, which is a triple whammy:
   1. You get a +5 bonus to Gender Euphoria for the evening.
   2. \[Censored.\]
   3. Reinforcement learning will happen at a deep level.
